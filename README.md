I will utilize an API to interface with an old Playstation Move Controller (PMC) for gathering inertial data from the controller.
  - The Move Controller will connect to my rpi via Bluetooth. 
  - The rpi will serve as an intermediate node for my laptop which will work as a server.
  - The rpi will run a program on the PMC and then report back the data to be uploaded and analyzed at the server and             visualized on Grafana.
